gameplay
========
- offline mode with Service Worker
- sub control refactor up/down = throttle, left/right = angle... (in theory, more realistic and easier input or lock)
- entity groups (foes and friend)
- some AI for enemies (attach player, evade torpedoes, follow a path)
- triangular bounding box for torpedo locking (instead of complete circle)
  or could use combination of inRange + delta angle between torpedo angle and sub angle...
- always centered on player + lerp (have grid move)
- some levels/missions (kill all, kill vip, protect vip)
- some rock formations (collide, indestructible)
- add parallax to rock formation to suggest 3D
- enemy submarines that also go offline
- firing in offline mode should reveal position temporarily
- proximity alert could reveal positions of both parties temporarily


release checklist
=================
- set definitive name in README.md and game.js#onload
- set game slug in Twitter URL in game.js#onkeyup
- make sure all PNGs are tinified
- test on Chrome/Firefox/Edge + Chrome/Firefox for Android

game engine
===========
- camera-window + edge-snapping + lerp-smoothing (new)
- sound engine (Soundbox smaller player, Sonant-X, Famitracker, lsdj)
- gamepad support

build chain
===========
- ? replace all the global variables by arguments with default value of the IIFE (e.g. const foo = 'bar' => (foo = 'bar') => { ... })
- ? mangle properties, and use cache names to replace all values matching an object propery that are assigned to a variable (e.g. hero.move = [], action = 'move' becomes a.b = [], c = 'move'... 'move' needs to be converted to 'b')

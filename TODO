release checklist
=================
x set definitive name in README.md and game.js#onload
x set game slug in Twitter URL in game.js#onkeyup
n/a make sure all PNGs are tinified
- take a good picture
- come up with description (brief story, controls, acknowledgment, browser support...)
- test on Chrome/Firefox/Edge

game engine
===========
- camera-window + edge-snapping + lerp-smoothing (new)
- sound engine (Soundbox smaller player, Sonant-X, Famitracker, lsdj)
- gamepad support

build chain
===========
- ? replace all the global variables by arguments with default value of the IIFE (e.g. const foo = 'bar' => (foo = 'bar') => { ... })
- ? mangle properties, and use cache names to replace all values matching an object propery that are assigned to a variable (e.g. hero.move = [], action = 'move' becomes a.b = [], c = 'move'... 'move' needs to be converted to 'b')
